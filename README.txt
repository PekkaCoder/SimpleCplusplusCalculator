A very simple C++ calculator for beginners. Does calculations with two numbers (+,x,/,-). Uses functions, enums and "passed by reference" function arguments. Aim is to have a good structure in this program.

This is a Visual Studio Community 2015 solution. If you are using some other compiler then take only Calculator.cpp and compile it with that compiler (like CodeBlocks).
